# Body Parsing Example


This is an example showing the use of Mask RCNN in a body parsing application. We train the model to detect:

1. Head
2. Torso
3. Upper arm
4. Lower arm
5. Upper leg
6. Lower leg

This implementation was based on [genausz's](https://github.com/genausz/Mask_RCNN) PASCAL VOC example. The dataset used for training was generated by [pose-guided knowledge transfer](https://github.com/MVIG-SJTU/WSHP).
